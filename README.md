# Todo App

## Description

This is a ToDo web application built with React.js and Node.js.

It was one of the projects in learning React.js for [Hack Your Future](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH) Denmark's curriculum.

The main functionalities of this website are:

-   Life cycle of using app  
-   Adding a new task
-   Possibility for editing a task
-   Adding deadline to a task
-   Removing a task
-   Marking a task as done

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, learned how to think in React using components and structuring my files. 

Through these challenges, I was able to gain a better understanding of using State and Effect.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and helped me grow as a developer.
